# TA<sup>2</sup>

* This is **a project done by Software Engineering (SE) students**.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application designed to help teaching assistants
  from the School of Computing keep track of their students' submissions.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* Teaching Assistant's Assistant (TA<sup>2</sup>) is a **desktop application designed for teaching assistants
  from the School of Computing(SOC) at the National University of Singapore(NUS) to help manage student information and keep track of students' assignment submissions.** 
* TA<sup>2</sup> is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative.
