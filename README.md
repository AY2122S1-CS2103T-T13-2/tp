#TA^2

* This is **a project done by Software Engineering (SE) students**.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application designed to help teaching assistants with organising their
  own modules as well as keeping track of their students' work.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `TA^2` as it is designed to be the assistant to teaching assistants.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative.
