Teaching Assistant's Assistant (TA<sup>2</sup>) is a **desktop app designed for teaching assistants/tutors/professors 
from the School of Computing to help manage student contacts and keep track of students' assignment submissions. TA<sup>2</sup> is  
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, TA<sup>2</sup> can get your contact and assignment management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have `Java 11` or later installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `ta2.jar` release from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.4).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TA<sup>2</sup>.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The window similar to the one shown below should appear in a few seconds.
   Note how the app contains some sample data when you run the app for the first time.<br>

6. You can try some commands by typing them in the command input box and press Enter to execute it.

   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`**: Lists all contacts.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe m/CS2100 e/e1234567@u.nus.edu`: Adds a student named `John Doe` with his/her relevant information into the contact list.

   * **`giveall`**`d/Assignment 1 m/CS2100 by/31/12/2021`: Adds an assignment call  `Assignment 1`, with deadline 2021, Dec 31,
     to the assignment list of all students in the contact list who are under the module `CS2100`.

8. Once you finished, and you don't want to keep these sample data. Try `clear` command to offer you a tidy and clean window, 
   and the journey of using TA<sup>2</sup> officially starts!

   * **`clear`**: Deletes all contacts.
   
9. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friends` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friends`, `t/Leader t/friends` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME e/EMAIL`, `e/EMAIL n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a command requires `INDEX` as an input, only one input for `INDEX` is expected. `INDEX` **must** be more than 0 and less than 10,000.<br>

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `m/cs2103 m/cs2101`, only `m/cs2101` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Viewing help: `help`

Shows a help window with a link directing you to the user guide. Alternatively this can be access by clicking the `Help` button
that can be found in the top left corner.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

Possible usage: 
* The help window can be useful if you would like to refer to the user guide for more details of the 
available features in TA<sup>2</sup>.


### Adding a student: `add`

Adds a student to the contact list with the student's relevant information.

Format: `add n/NAME e/EMAIL m/MODULE [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

* Duplicate `NAME` is **not allowed**.
  
    * e.g. `add n/Alex Yeoh...` is not allowed if there is already a student named Alex Yeoh in the contact list.

* Extra spaces before and between names will be removed.

* A student's `MODULE` must follow the format as shown [here.](#module-naming-convention)

* Only student's initials and module code will be capitalised on the displayed student list.<br>

    * e.g. `n/alex yeoh`, `n/DAVID LI` will be converted to `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li` respectively.<br>

    * e.g. `cs2100`, `GER1000t` will be converted to `CS2100` and `GER1000T` respectively.<br>

* A student's `EMAIL` must follow the format:

    * The whole `EMAIL` must have a **maximum of 320 characters**.
    
    * The local part must have a **maximum of 64 characters**.
      
    * The domain name must have a **maximum of 255 characters**.

* Duplicate `EMAIL` is **not allowed**.

    * e.g. `add e/E1234567@u.nus.edu` is not allowed if there is already a student with the same email.
    
* `TAG` can only accept alphanumeric characters.

* A student can have any number of `TAG` (including 0).<br>

</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe m/CS1010 e/e1234567@u.nus.edu`

* `add n/alex yeoh e/e1234123@u.nus.edu m/GEQ1000 t/T17`

Possible Usage:

* You can use `add` to add new students into the contact list when you receive new students.

* `TAG` can be used to separate students by their tutorial group or to mark out students that require more attention.

### Finding students with matching input keywords: `find`

Displays the list of people who match any of the input keywords. The matching is based
on an ***OR*** basis, where if a student matches at **least one keyword**, that student will
be considered as matched and thus displayed.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [m/MODULE] [t/TAG]...`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

1. There should be at least one prefix.

2. Ordering of prefixes are not strict and presence of multiple keywords are acceptable.

3. Keywords are **case-insensitive** <br> e.g. `cs1101s` will match `CS1101S`.

4. Each part of name separated by space will be match. <br> 
   e.g. `n/Hans` or `n/Bo` will both match `Hans Bo`. <br>
   e.g. `n/Sam` will match `Sam Tan` but not `Samuel Lee`.

5. Students' names matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). <br>
   e.g. `n/Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.

6. Prefixes with empty keywords will not match anyone. <br>
   e.g. `find n/ m/ t/` will return 0 students

7. Module codes must strictly follow the module naming convention shown [here.](#module-naming-convention)

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

  e.g. `m/CS1101S CS2103T` or `m/CS1101S m/CS2103T` will return people who take either modules.
</div>

Examples:
* `find n/Bernice` returns the students with name of `Bernice`.

* `find n/Evian m/CS2103T t/Group10` returns the students who at least satisfy one of the requirements: with the name `Evian`, study module`CS2103T` or with the tag `Group10`.
* `find t/E34 n/Brian m/GEQ1000` returns the students who at least satisfy one of the requirements: with the name `Brian`, study module`GEQ1000` or with the tag `E34`.
* `find n/alex david m/cs1231 cs2103t` returns the students who at least satisfy one of the requirements:
  containing `david` or `alex` as separated parts of their names, study module`cs1231` or `cs2103t` (Shown in the image below).
![result for 'find Example'](images/userguide/findExample.png)
  
Possible Usage:

* Require **at least one** prefix to edit.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**

* You can modify several parts of student information at the same time.
  
* If you wish to remove the tags for a student, simply type `t/` prefix without any parameters.
</div>

Examples:

* `edit 2 e/e0001111@u.nus.edu` replaces the second student's email in the displayed contact list with `e0001111@u.nus.edu`.

  ![result for 'show assignment list'](images/userguide/showAssignmentListResult.png)
