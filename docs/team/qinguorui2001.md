### Project: TA<sup>2</sup>

TA<sup>2</sup> is a desktop application designed for teaching assistants from the School of Computing (SoC) at the National University of Singapore (NUS) to manage student information and keep track of studentsâ€™ assignment submissions.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
    * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add assignments into the student's assignment list.
    * What it does: allows the user to add a specific assignment to a student. Newly added assignment will be immediately shown in the assignment list.
    * Justification: This feature ensures the basic function of the product because tutors are responsible for allocating assignments to their students.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects commands to be added in the future. The implementation was straightforward as it refers to the command pattern from existing commands.
    * Credits: *{no}*

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete assignments from the student's assignment list.
    * What it does: allows the user to delete a specific assignment from a student's assignments. Newly deleted assignment will be immediately removed from the assignment list.
    * Justification: This feature ensures the basic function of the product because tutors are responsible for managing assignments for their students.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects commands to be added in the future. The implementation was straightforward as it refers to the command pattern from existing commands.
    * Credits: *{no}*

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark assignments as completed in the student's assignment list.
  * What it does: allows the user to mark a specific assignment of a student as completed. Newly marked assignment will be immediately shown as `Completed` in the assignment list.
  * Justification: This feature ensures the basic function of the product because tutors are responsible for marking assignments of their students.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects commands to be added in the future. The implementation was straightforward as it refers to the command pattern from existing commands.

    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
    * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
    * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
